<div class="paragraph" style="text-align:left;display:block;"><strong style=""><br /><br /><br />The Disappearance of Haruhi Suzumiya</strong>&nbsp;(<strong style="">&#28092;&#23470;&#12495;&#12523;&#12498;&#12398;&#28040;&#22833;</strong>&nbsp;<em style="">Suzumiya Haruhi no Sh&#333;shitsu</em>) is a film based on the fourth Haruhi Suzumiya light novel of the&nbsp;same name. Directed by&nbsp;Tatsuya Ishihara&nbsp;and written by&nbsp;Nagaru Tanigawa, it was released in Japan on February 6th, 2010. The movie has a run time of 163 minutes, the equivalent of 7 episodes.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><strong>Summary</strong><br />On December 17, a month after the cultural festival, the SOS Brigade organizes a Christmas hotpot party.&nbsp;Kyon&nbsp;is skeptical of its success though still helps decorate the clubroom. On his way home, Kyon talks to&nbsp;Taniguchi, who announces that he has a date from&nbsp;Kouyouen&nbsp;planned for the following week. Kyon reaches his house and falls asleep.<br /><br />While walking to school the following day,&nbsp;Kyon&nbsp;sees Taniguchi wearing a face mask. Taniguchi claims that he has cold, denying having the date he mentioned previously. Kyon continues to school, finding that a cold epidemic has suddenly spread around his class. Kyon notices that Haruhi is absent.&nbsp;Ryouko Asakura&nbsp;appears instead, who Kyon believes to have been dead for several months. Kyon questions her, though his classmates assure him that she had been there the whole year. They are also unaware of Haruhi's existence.<br /><br />Kyon tries to find&nbsp;Yuki&nbsp;and&nbsp;Itsuki, but discovers that Isuki's entire classroom and Yuki have disappeared. On his way back to class, Kyon encounters Mikuru and&nbsp;Tsuruya, who do not remember him. In a final attempt to find his friends, Kyon goes to the&nbsp;Literature Club&nbsp;room. He finds Yuki, though she is human rather than alien. All of the items kept by the SOS Brigade are missing and the computer is and older model with no SOS files. When Kyon leaves, Yuki asks him to join the Literature Club. Noticing Yuki's shyness and her human manner, Kyon takes the sign-up sheet out of kindness.<br /><br />When Kyon gets home, he tries to get&nbsp;Shamisen&nbsp;to talk to him the way he did in&nbsp;<em style="">The Sigh of Haruhi Suzumiya</em>, but to no avail. Disappointed, Kyon goes to sleep.<br /><br />Kyon returns to the Literature Club room the next day and finds&nbsp;<em style="">The Fall of Hyperion</em>, which was the same book Yuki used to reveal her true identity in the<em style="">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</em>. Kyon opens the book and finds a bookmark which reads: "Program Run Condition: Collect the keys. Deadline: Two Days Later". Kyon is unsure about the message's significance and decides to visit Yuki's house for clues. When they arrive, Kyon realizes that Yuki has one memory of him: an incident from&nbsp;<em style="">The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya</em>&nbsp;where he helped her get a library card. However, Yuki remembers him as a random passerby rather than a brigade member. Ryouko Asakura comes to visit Yuki, startling Kyon who tries to back out. Yuki pulls on his sleeve as he attempts to exit. Kyon is moved by Yuki's display of affection and stays. He finds that this Ryouko is just a friendly neighbor who helps Yuki. Kyon still feels uneasy around Ryouko as they leave despite her kindness towards him.<br /><br />The next day (December 20), Kyon mentions Haruhi to Taniguchi, who recognizes the name. He apparently went to Haruhi's middle school and tells Kyon that she attends Kouyouen School. Stunned, Kyon thanks Taniguchi and leaves school to find Haruhi. He finds both Haruhi and Itsuki, who were walking home after school. Kyon notices that Haruhi has a similar facial expression and demeanor to the one she had before she made the SOS Brigade. Kyon finds Haruhi and tries to speak to her, but she pushes him off as she does not remember him. Kyon then asks her about the incidents at the&nbsp;<a href="http://haruhi.wikia.com/wiki/Tanabata" title="" style="">Tanabata</a>&nbsp;of three years ago, and when she realizes that he knows of all of that, he tells her that he is "John Smith", the alias that he used during the "Bamboo Leaf Rhapsody" incident. Haruhi faints and is caught by Itsuki.<br /><br />After recovering, Haruhi listens to everything Kyon says about his alternate universe. He tells her about Yuki being an alien, Itsuki being an esper, Mikuru being a time traveler, and Haruhi having strange powers. Intrigued, Haruhi decides to gather the former SOS Brigade members and meet them.<br /><br />Kyon notices that Itsuki is close to Haruhi. Itsuki admits that he has a crush on her, and thinks she is a captivating person. While they travel to North High, Kyon tries to understand what Itsuki sees in her. Koizumi notes that if Kyon's Haruhi took notice of him for no particular reason, he concludes that she loves him.<br /><br />Pretending to be students at North High, they take Mikuru from the Calligraphy Club and bring her to the Literature Club room. Once they enter the room, the computer spontaniously activates and displays a message. The message explains that there is a program in the computer which will allow him to return to his world. Kyon activates it, but instead of returning to his original universe, he finds himself in the Tanabata of three years ago. He finds the older Mikuru, who directs him to Yuki's house. There, Yuki explains that someone altered the world on December 17, changing everyone's memories within one year. She injects nanomachines into Mikuru and Kyon to protect them and provides a weapon to normalize the culprit, which Yuki reveals to be herself. Yuki had altered the world because of "errors", which Kyon later deems to be emotions that she couldn't understand. He realizes that Yuki had only preserved Kyon's memories so he could choose to return.<br /><br />Kyon and Mikuru travel to December 18 to witness Yuki warping reality. Before Kyon fires his gun at the changed Yuki, he ponders whether to go back to his old world. He concedes that his old world was a much more interesting place and is about to shoot Yuki when Ryouko intervenes, stabbing him in the back. Kyon's vision starts to blur and he becomes delirious with blood loss. He sees the younger and the older Mikurus crying over his body. Before Ryouko finishes him off, another Yuki catches Ryouko's knife. Someone comes up to Kyon and tells him not to worry. Kyon then loses consciousness.<br /><br />Sometime later, Kyon wakes up in a hospital run by Itsuki's&nbsp;Organization, and finds that the world has been normalized. According to Ituski, after discussing plans for Christmas, Kyon fell down the stairs and entered into a coma. The entire group had been shaken, especially Haruhi, who had stayed with Kyon the whole time he was hospitalized. Kyon looks over to see her asleep in a sleeping bag. She wakes up after Kyon touches her hair, scolding Kyon for scaring her and claiming that it was her duty to look after injured brigade members. Everyone proceeds to reunite with Kyon.<br /><br />During his final hours at the hospital, Kyon wonders who the mysterious person was, figuring that it was his future self who had time traveled with Mikuru and Yuki. Following his release, Kyon visits Yuki to apologize for causing her emotion induced error, addressing her by her given name "Yuki" for the first time. Yuki tells him that her violation is being assessed by the&nbsp;Integrated Data Sentient Entity&nbsp;because it is afraid she will make further errors. Kyon grabs Yuki's hand and promises that if they decommision Yuki, the SOS brigade will do whatever it takes to retrieve her. He warns that he would reveal everyone's true identity to Haruhi and let her destroy the the Entity. Yuki thanks Kyon and tranfers the message.<br /><br />On Christmas Eve, Kyon considers his duty to go back in time and save himself, but concludes that the world can wait and joins Haruhi's hotpot party.<br /><br />After the credits roll, Yuki is seen at a public library watching a boy helping a girl get a library card. After they leave, Yuki continues reading. She covers her mouth with the book, possibly hiding a smile.<br /><br /></div>
